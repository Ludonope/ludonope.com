    "bio": "At the age of 8, I searched “how to hack” on Google. This led me to discover the world of computer science and programming beginning with C, then later C++ and beyond. This allowed me to hone my skills with algorithms and object-oriented programming from a very young age. From then on, I have continued to follow this childhood dream, which has now become a full-fledged passion."
